 <li>Consider the vectors given in the picture below. Sketch (or explain what you want to sketch) what each of the following span looks like, and explain your reasoning in words and pictures.

Consider three vectors in, and

 <li>Write a system of equations that has the same solution as the vector equation you wrote in part (a).</li>

 <li>Which one of the following best describes the solutions to your equations in part (a) and (b)? Choose one please.

 <li>For this problem, you will need a 3D plotting tool. You may use any software of your choice. If you do not have one, use this free online tool</li>

</ol>

To plot a vector using the online tool, click the radio button next to ”Add to graph:” on the panel to the left of the graphing area, and select ”Vector: <em>&lt; a,b,c &gt;</em>”. You may then enter components of the vector you want to plot. You may rotate the plot by clicking in the graphing area and drag your pointer around.
